# Early Learning (0-3 Years)

## Montessori Principles for Ages 0-3
The Montessori approach for infants and toddlers focuses on **independence, sensory exploration, and a prepared environment** that supports natural development. The key principles include:

### **1. Respect for the Child**
- Allow freedom of movement and exploration.
- Provide child-sized tools and materials to encourage independence.

### **2. Prepared Environment**
- Create a safe, accessible space where everything has a purpose.
- Organize toys and materials on low shelves for easy access.

### **3. Hands-On Learning**
- Encourage sensory experiences (touch, sight, sound, taste, smell).
- Use real objects instead of plastic toys whenever possible.

### **4. Independence & Practical Life Skills**
- Foster self-care skills: dressing, eating, and cleaning up.
- Allow toddlers to participate in daily household tasks (pouring, sweeping, washing hands).

### **5. Language & Communication**
- Speak clearly and narrate daily activities.
- Offer books, songs, and rich verbal interaction.

## Developmental Objectives (0-3 Years)
### **0-6 Months**
- Strengthen grasping reflex and hand-eye coordination.
- Encourage tummy time for physical development.
- Introduce high-contrast images and simple sounds.

### **6-12 Months**
- Support crawling, standing, and early walking.
- Introduce object permanence games (e.g., peekaboo).
- Offer simple puzzles and stacking toys.

### **12-18 Months**
- Encourage self-feeding and drinking from an open cup.
- Introduce language through naming objects.
- Provide activities for fine motor skills (e.g., transferring objects, simple lacing).

### **18-24 Months**
- Support early independence (putting on shoes, helping with small tasks).
- Offer sensory play opportunities (sand, water, playdough).
- Encourage social interaction through turn-taking activities.

### **24-36 Months**
- Expand self-care routines (brushing teeth, dressing, cleaning up after meals).
- Introduce counting and early mathematical concepts (sorting, matching, sequencing).
- Encourage creativity through music, movement, and simple arts & crafts.
