# Homeschool Coding & Engineering Curriculum 

## Overview
This repository is designed as a **progressive homeschool program**, spanning from infancy to high school. The curriculum focuses on **computer programming, engineering, mathematics, and reading**, scaling with age to provide a well-rounded understanding of computing and problem-solving while also covering all traditional subjects as required by Pennsylvania homeschooling laws.

## Instructional Requirements (Pennsylvania Home Education Program)
- **Annual Instruction Hours:**
  - **Elementary Level (K-6):** 180 days or 900 hours per year
  - **Secondary Level (7-12):** 180 days or 990 hours per year

## Structure
The repository is organized into different learning stages and subjects:

```
/01-Early-Learning   ->  Simple interactions, basic commands, visual elements
/02-Beginner-Coding  ->  Command-line basics, text-based programming, Python intro
/03-Mathematics      ->  Logical thinking, number patterns, interactive math problems, algebra, geometry
/04-Reading          ->  Phonics-based reading exercises, comprehension games, literature analysis
/05-Engineering      ->  Arduino, robotics, circuits, hands-on projects
/06-Advanced-Coding  ->  Game development, software projects, AI & security concepts
/07-Science          ->  Physics, chemistry, biology, hands-on experiments
/08-History          ->  U.S. history, Pennsylvania history, world history, civics
/09-Geography        ->  Maps, Earth sciences, spatial awareness
/10-Language Arts    ->  Writing, grammar, storytelling, literature analysis, speech
/11-Art & Creativity ->  Drawing, music, digital design, creative projects
/12-Physical Education -> Movement, exercise, coordination, health education, safety education (including fire prevention)
```


## Progression System
- Each branch of knowledge will have a **completion page and badge of understanding**.
- Ember can pass **tests, coding challenges, or build projects** to unlock the next levels.
- The program will **scale with her growth**, introducing new concepts at each stage.

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Initial Setup
✅ GitHub repository structure  
✅ README overview  
⬜ Basic lesson outlines for early stages  
⬜ Draft badge system concept  

### Phase 2: First Learning Modules
⬜ Interactive command-line lessons (typing name, simple inputs)  
⬜ First math challenges (counting, basic operations)  
⬜ Early reading activities (phonics, letter recognition)  
⬜ Basic Arduino blinking LED project  

### Phase 3: Interactive & Community Expansion
⬜ Set up GitHub Pages for tracking progress  
⬜ Automate tests and quizzes  
⬜ Expand with collaborative projects  

## Contributing
This project will evolve as Ember grows, but it can also be shared with other parents looking for a structured homeschool STEM curriculum with **a strong emphasis on coding and engineering while covering all traditional subjects** required by Pennsylvania law.

### **Updating the README on GitHub**
Once you've updated the file, run:
```bash
cd ~/HomeSchool
git add README.md
git commit -m "Fixed README formatting"
git push origin main
